## On Flight Test
>KP-2C will not available for test during vacation  
>* GuMoon Told Landing gear should be installed in KP-2C within January $\rightarrow$ Ground test should be done untill Feb.
>* Considering the working period and the ground test period, KP-2C aircraft are difficult to use for flight test
>* KP-2C has a damage on Nose, and The screw that connects the wing to the fuselage is aging
>* We have to change screw and do repair and reinforcement work  

$\rightarrow$ We have to start wiring KP-2D  
* Before Start, We have to Report this issue to GuMoon and Permission shall be obtained for wiring of KP-2D.  
  * Because F/T team is the department responsible for the management of airframe and materials
